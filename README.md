# Today I Learn
Here is my TIL. A quick note of what i've learned/discovered today  about this beautiful coding universe.
Working on digital projects, and overall, learning code and programmation, have taught me one very important thing : you need to keep learning. Always. Everytime. Everyday. And it's good, i feel great when i experience something new.
